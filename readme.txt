= Can I run Ultimate Live Chat completely on my own server and not as a hosted solution? =

Yes, you can, but you need to install Joomla! CMS into a subfolder on your WordPress website and then bridge the connection, because JLive! Chat requires Joomla CMS as the base in order to run it in stand-alone mode on your own server.
